# ðŸ§  HYPATIA - Adversarial Machine Learning Testing Platform
> *"Reserve your right to think, for even to think wrongly is better than not to think at all."*  
> **â€” Hypatia of Alexandria**
Named after **Hypatia of Alexandria**, the renowned ancient mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, this platform embodies her spirit of rigorous inquiry and fearless pursuit of knowledge. Just as Hypatia challenged conventional thinking in her time, **HYPATIA** challenges your machine learning models to reveal their vulnerabilities and strengthen their defenses against adversarial threats.
> ## ðŸŒŸ Overview

HYPATIA is a comprehensive adversarial machine learning testing platform built with Streamlit that provides researchers and practitioners with tools to evaluate ML model robustness through systematic adversarial testing. The platform supports four major categories of attacks across multiple threat models.
